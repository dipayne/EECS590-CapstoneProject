# EECS590-CapstoneProject
This repository implements a research-oriented reinforcement learning framework grounded in an explicit Markov Decision Process (MDP). It includes dynamic programming methods for policy evaluation and improvement, a modular agent training pipeline, and infrastructure to support future model-based and model-free RL experimentation.
